For this android project you will need:

. Android SDK
. Android NDK
. Android source

The reason for needing the Android source is that we are linking to internal
libraries and need access to versions of the libraries with symbols and also to
the header files.

To build the binary library components, you need to:

1. From the parent of contrib, type . ./contrib/envsetup.sh
2. Edit contrib/android/jni/Android.mk and set the two variables:
MY_ANDROID_SRC and MY_ANDROID_LIBS accordingly. The values set there are
examples only.

Then one builds the project using the NDK ndk-build from the jni directory and
then builds the application using either ant or eclipse.
