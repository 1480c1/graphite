*** Linux MonoDevelop build instructions. ***

To run unittests first install the libgraphite2-2.0.0 package and ensure that the Paduak font is installed.

1. Open NGraphite.sln in MonoDevelop.
2. Build All
3. Optionally run unittests by:
- View -> Unittesting
- Right click on NGraphite top level target -> Run test.

The build should produce:
NGraphite.dll + NGraphite.dll.config
These should exist NGraphite/bin/Debug if a debug build was done or NGraphite/bin/Release if a release build was done.
