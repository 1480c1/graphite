== Calling GraphiteNG ==

=== Introduction ===
The basic model for running graphite is to pass text, font and face information
to create a segment. A segment consists of a linked list of slots which each
correspond to an output glyph. In addition a segment holds charinfo for each
character in the input text.

<1> The first parameter to the program is the full path to the font file to be used for
    rendering. This function loads the font and reads all the graphite tables, etc. If
    there is a fault in the font, it will fail to load and the function will return NULL.

<2> A font is merely a face at a given size in pixels per em. It is possible to support
    hinted advances, but this is done via a callback function.

<3> For simplification of memory allocation, graphite works on characters (Unicode
    codepoints) rather than bytes or uint16s, etc. We need to calculate the number of
    characters in the input string (the second parameter to the program). Very often
    applications already know this. If there is an error in the utf-8, the pError variable
    will point to it and we just exit. But it is possible to render up to that point.

<4> Here we create a segment. A segment is the results of processing a string of text with
    graphite. It contains all the information necessary for final rendering including all
    the glyphs, their positions, relationships between glyphs and underlying characters,
    etc.

<5> A segment primarily consists of a linked list of slots. Each slot corresponds to a
    glyph in the output. The information about a glyph and its relationships is queried
    from the slot.

Source for this program may be found in tests/examples/simple.c

Assuming that graphiteng has been built and installed, this example can be built and run on linux using:

----
gcc -o simple -lgraphiteng simple.c
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib ./simple ../fonts/Padauk.ttf 'Hello World!'
----

Running simple gives the results:

----
43(0.000000,0.000000) 72(9.859375,0.000000) 79(17.609375,0.000000) 79(20.796875,0.000000) 82(23.984375,0.000000) 3(32.203125,0.000000) 58(38.109375,0.000000) 82(51.625000,0.000000) 85(59.843750,0.000000) 79(64.875000,0.000000) 71(68.062500,0.000000) 4(76.281250,0.000000)

Not very pretty, but reassuring! Graphite isn't a graphical rendering engine, it merely calculates which glyphs should render where and leaves the actual process of displaying those glyphs to other libraries.

=== Details ===

Here we talk about the details of working with key classes

==== Face ====

Different ways of creating faces. Glyph information caching, etc.

==== Font ====

This can even be NULL.

==== Features ====

Language, script and default values along with modifying them.
