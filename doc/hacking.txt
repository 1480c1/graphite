== Hacking ==

In this section we look at coding conventions and some of the design models used in coding graphiteng.

=== Memory Allocation ===

+++While GraphiteNG is written in C++, it is targetted at environments where
libstdc++ is not present. While this can be problematic since functions used in
C++ may be arbitrarily placed in libc and libstdc++, there are general
approaches that can help. To this end we use a mixed memory allocation model.
For graphiteng classes, we declare our own new() methods and friends, allowing
the use of C++ new() and all that it gives us in terms of constructors. For
types that are not classes we use malloc() or the type safe version gralloc().+++
