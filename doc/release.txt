== Release Process ==

These notes are not necessarily part of the manual. They are here for code developers to remember to do the right thing when it comes to release day.

. The first line of the Changelog must be the version number. This is so that packagers can extract the version number from the source.
. Make sure the version numbers in the #defines reflect the release number in includes/graphite2/Font.h
. Make sure the libtool version numbers are correct in src/CMakeLists.txt
. Ensure the builds.palaso.org gives a clear build

== Anticipated API Changes ==

Here are the things we will probably change in the API once we come to the conclusion that we have got to change the API for some really important reason.
